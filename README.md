# AntFarm
Project 'AntFarm' is a digital evolution simulator built in the GODOT engine. Developement is slow and spoadic, so contributions are welcome. Please maintain good branching practice. Branch names should begin with "feature_" or "bugfix_". Binaries are not pre-compiled, but the project can be easily run in debug mode or exported by downloading the free GODOT engine and following the instructions at https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable .
